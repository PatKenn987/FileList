This program will be used in the JustCurious website build.  I have been able to use PhotoGallery in the travel section 
of the website to provide a icon list of the photos and then a gallery list if someone clicks on any photo.  What I want to 
do to make the process more generic is to dump the files that I want to use into a folder, and then generate an array that 
contains the picture name, the height and width of the photo, a caption and a title for the photo

I would like the list of folders to be processed to be provided in a files
I would like the array data for each folder to be stored in a file in the folder


I used this to help me get the list of files

This helped me store the list to a file
